# Models Folder Improvements

## Overview
The Models folder has been restructured and improved to follow better architectural patterns and clean code principles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Folder Structure Reorganization
- **Before**: All models mixed in single `Models/` folder
- **After**: Organized into logical subfolders:
  ```
  Models/
  ??? Requests/          # Request DTOs
  ?   ??? LoginRequest.cs
  ?   ??? RegisterRequest.cs
  ??? Responses/         # Response DTOs
  ?   ??? ApiResponse.cs
  ?   ??? LoginResponse.cs
  ?   ??? RegisterResponse.cs
  ??? BaseEntity.cs      # Base class for common properties
  ??? RefreshToken.cs    # Refresh token entity
  ??? Role.cs           # User role entity
  ??? User.cs           # User entity
  ```

### 2. Entity Model Improvements

#### User.cs
- **Fixed**: Removed redundant properties already in `IdentityUser`
- **Added**: Navigation properties for relationships
- **Added**: Helper property `FullName`
- **Added**: Proper validation attributes

#### Role.cs
- **Before**: Empty class inheriting from `IdentityRole`
- **After**: Added meaningful properties (`Description`, `CreatedAt`, `IsActive`)

#### RefreshToken.cs
- **Before**: Nearly empty class inheriting from `IdentityUserToken`
- **After**: Complete entity with proper properties and relationships
- **Added**: Helper properties (`IsExpired`, `IsRevoked`, `IsActive`)
- **Added**: Foreign key relationship with User

### 3. New Base Classes and Patterns

#### BaseEntity.cs
- Created abstract base class for common entity properties
- Includes: `Id`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `IsDeleted`, `DeletedAt`
- Supports soft delete pattern

#### ApiResponse<T>.cs
- Generic response wrapper for consistent API responses
- Includes success/error status, messages, and error collections
- Factory methods for creating success and error responses

### 4. Database Context Improvements
- Updated to use custom `User` and `Role` models instead of base Identity classes
- Added proper entity configurations with:
  - String length constraints
  - Indexes for performance
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Default values for timestamps

### 5. Request/Response Model Enhancements
- **LoginRequest**: Clean validation attributes
- **RegisterRequest**: Added optional `FirstName` and `LastName` fields
- **LoginResponse**: Added `FullName` property
- **RegisterResponse**: Added `FullName` and `RegisteredAt` properties

### 6. Namespace Organization
- Request models: `SOCApi.Models.Requests`
- Response models: `SOCApi.Models.Responses`
- Core entities remain in: `SOCApi.Models`

### 7. Additional Services Created
- `IEmailSender` interface and basic implementation
- Proper service organization in `Services/Email/` folder

## Benefits of These Changes

### Better Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to navigate and maintain
- Follows standard .NET project structure patterns

### Improved Type Safety
- Proper validation attributes
- Nullable reference types support
- Strong typing throughout

### Enhanced Maintainability
- Base classes reduce code duplication
- Consistent patterns across models
- Better extensibility for future features

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient relationship configurations
- Soft delete support for audit trails

### API Consistency
- Standardized response format
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Better client developer experience

## Breaking Changes
- **Namespace changes**: Controllers and services need updated using statements
- **Database schema**: May require migrations for RefreshToken changes
- **API responses**: New response format may affect existing clients

## Next Steps
1. Run Entity Framework migrations to update database schema
2. Update any remaining controllers to use new namespaces
3. Consider implementing proper email service with actual SMTP configuration
4. Add additional validation rules as business requirements evolve
